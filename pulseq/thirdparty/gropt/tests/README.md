# Testing

Test cases are stored in hdf5 files in the tests/cases/ folder that contain a set of inputs and the output waveform.

run_all_tests.py will run all of the test cases and compare the output waveforms, constraints, number of iterations and compute times required.

## Generating tests

It doesn't hurt to keep adding more tests, see all of the test_design notebooks to see how they are generated.
